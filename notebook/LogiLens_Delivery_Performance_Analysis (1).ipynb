        "This project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global pharmaceutical shipments to identify patterns, risks, and operational inefficiencies affecting on-time delivery and insurance costs. By integrating multiple data sources related to shipment mode, vendor performance, freight cost, insurance value, and timeline metrics, the analysis explores how various logistical and managerial factors influence delivery outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key business questions addressed include:**\n",
        "- Are specific teams (e.g., PMO - US) more effective at managing on-time deliveries?\n",
        "- How does the **mode of shipment** (air, sea, etc.) impact the likelihood of delays?\n",
        "- Do **geographic factors** or **country of origin** play a role in late deliveries?\n",
        "- What is the effect of **shipment weight** on insurance cost?\n",
        "- Does the **INCO term** influence vendor performance?\n",
        "- Is there a relationship between **PO processing time** and delivery punctuality?\n",
        "\n",
        "Through visualizations and statistical methods, the project reveals operational trends and pinpoints bottlenecks. The insights generated will enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve vendor management, optimize logistics strategy, and reduce costs and delays across the supply chain."

        "- **Geographic Risk Management:** Countries of origin and destination impact delay rates. Introduce region-specific strategies like buffer timelines or alternate routes for high-risk geographies.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **INCO Terms and PO Processing:** Delays were linked to longer PO processing times and specific INCO terms. Streamlining the procurement workflow and negotiating better contractual terms can improve on-time performance.\n",
